## Goal
The purpose of this project is to build an adaptive PDE solver for an European option pricing model, namely the Black Scholes model for a European option. 

As a closed-form numerical solution of the Black Scholes PDE already exists, we will compare the approximate solution to our PDE solver to the value obtained from the closed-form formula. 

This is to get started with solving PDE's and to learn how to set up methods to solve PDE's that may not have a closed form in the future. 

## Method
We will start with an explicit Euler, then implicit Euler, and finalise with the Crank-Nicolson method of solving PDE's
